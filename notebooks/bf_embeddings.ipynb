INTRODUCTIONThe Bugs Framework (BF) builds on these commonly used lists of software weaknesses and vulnerabilities,while addressing the problems that they have. It is being developed as a structured, complete, orthogonal, and languageindependent classification of software bugs and weaknesses.Structured means a weakness is described via one cause,one operation, one consequence, and one value per attributefrom the lists defining a BF class. This ensures precisecausal descriptions. Complete means BF has the expressiveness power to describe any software bug or weakness. This ensures there are no gaps in coverage. Orthogonal means thesets of operations of any two BF classes do not overlap.This ensures there are no overlaps in coverage. BF is alsoapplicable for source code in any programming language.The cause/consequence relation is a key aspect of BF'smethodology that sets it apart from any other efforts. Itallows describing and chaining the bug and the weaknessesunderlining a vulnerability, as well as identifying a bug froma final error and what is required to fix the bug., Score: 0.441997110844\n",
